This package contains gpycomplete.

1. Introduction

   gpycomplete is a python code autocompletion and helper suite for
   GNU/Emacs. It feels like having ipython in your buffer.

   gpycomplete is written from scratch by Fabián E. Gallina, althought
   some funcions (namely get_help and get_signature) are strongly
   inspired in the original pycomplete package that was available at
   http://python-mode.sf.net.

   The main feature of gpycomplete is that the completions it returns
   are actually what the python interpreter running in the background
   has available in its context. This is what makes gpycomplete so
   powerful and what it gives the feel of ipython.


2. Requirements

   To use gpycomplete you must have Pymacs. The recommended version is
   the latest stable release 0.23 (since this package was sucessfully
   tested with that version). If you run this package with a different
   version please let me know at:
   fgallina --at-- caffeinegroup --dot-- com --dot-- ar

   You can download Pymacs 0.23 from:
   http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca/archives/Pymacs-0.23.tar.gz


3. Installation

   To install gpycomplete just put gpycomplete.el in a directory which
   is included in your Emacs load-path and put gpycomplete.py in some
   folder included in your python path (normally /usr/lib/python2.5/
   is OK)

   After putting the files in their appropiate directories just add
   the following to your ~/.emacs file:

   (require 'gpycomplete)

   Restart Emacs or use load-file ~/.emacs.


4. Usage

   gpycomplete binds the following keystrokes:

   [tab] : Tries to get the completions of the current expression, if
   	   only one completion is available then it inserts it in hte buffer
   	   else if no completions are available indents.

   [(] : inserts a "(" and displays the signature of the current
         expression.

   [,] : inserts a "," and displays the signature of the current
         expression.

   [f1] : prints the help string of the current expression.

   [f2] : prompts the user for the object he wants to get the
   	  signature and displays it.

   [f3] : prompts the user for the object he wants to get the help
   	  string and displays it.

   [.] : refreshes context to the interpreter and inserts a ".".

   [return] : refreshes the context to the interpreter and inserts a
   	      newline.

   gpycomplete provides the following interactive commands:

   gpy-add-path, gpy-check-errors, gpy-complete-and-indent,
   gpy-electric-comma, gpy-electric-lparen, gpy-help,
   gpy-help-at-point, gpy-refresh-and-dot, gpy-refresh-and-newline,
   gpy-refresh-context, gpy-set-django-project, gpy-signature

   Besides the names are almost self-explanatory you can get the
   documentation of them by using C-h f <name of the function>
