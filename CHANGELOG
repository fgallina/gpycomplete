0.2 (December 24, 2008):

          * Added customizable variables to control the way
            gpycomplete behaves

          * Added partial completion, this means that when you have as
            possible completions "this_is_a_var" and
            "this_is_a_function" hitting tab will insert up to
            "this_is_a_"

          * First steps to support local completion within classes,
            methods and functions. Now gpycomplete will autocomplete
            names but you will not be able to iterate within their
            properties
