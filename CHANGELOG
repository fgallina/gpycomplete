0.3 (May 10, 2009):

          * Fixed bug that caused the deletion of the previous word
            when the available completions started with "__"

          * Added support to complete when the self keyword is used

0.2 (December 24, 2008):

          * Added customizable variables to control the way
            gpycomplete behaves

          * Added partial completion, this means that when you have as
            possible completions "this_is_a_var" and
            "this_is_a_function" hitting tab will insert up to
            "this_is_a_"

          * First steps to support local completion within classes,
            methods and functions. Now gpycomplete will autocomplete
            names but you will not be able to iterate within their
            properties

0.1 (December 07, 2008):

	 * Initial Release, see readme.txt for features
